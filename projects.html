                    For this project, I used <b>Tableau</b> to analyze the 2024 Olympic Games data, focusing on athlete participation, gender distribution, and country contributions. The analysis revealed 11,110 athletes from 206 countries, with a near-equal gender split of 5,655 male and 5,455 female athletes. The United States led with 619 athletes, contributing 5.572% of the total. Sports like Equestrian, 3x3 Basketball, and Triathlon showcased gender balance, while Athletics had a slight male skew. The project highlighted the progress toward gender parity in sports and showcased the diversity and inclusivity of the Games through insightful Tableau visualizations.

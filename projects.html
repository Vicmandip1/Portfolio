                    <li>The dashboards I created facilitated data-driven decision-making in recruitment and applicant management by providing clear insights into applicant demographics, experience, and skills. These visualizations enabled the team to quickly identify top candidates based on location, sector, and expertise, ensuring that the hiring process was more efficient and targeted.</li>
                    <li>The project faced difficulties extracting structured data from unstructured resumes due to varied formats and inconsistencies in presenting key details like education, experience, and skills. Advanced text extraction techniques and natural language processing methods were applied to convert this unstructured data into usable formats.</li>
                    <li>Streamlined the data pipeline process, minimizing the need for manual data entry by automating key workflows. New data in the database is automatically updated on the dashboard.</li>
                    <li>I used SQL queries to extract, join, and transform raw data from the ATS into structured formats for analysis. Additionally, Python (with libraries like Pandas) was utilized for data cleansing, validation, and advanced integration tasks to ensure consistency and accuracy across datasets.</li>
